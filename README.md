# About

Noteflight only gives you the option to make tuplets with up to 7 notes, but if you take a look at its code, you'll notice that you can actually make tuplets of any size! I made this userscript because I didn't want to have to keep pasting code into the console every time I opened a score.

# How to use

1. Install the userscript by choosing a version from the releases page of this repo.
2. Select the note or rest you want to turn into a tuplet.
3. In the Rhythm palette, click the septuplet button.
4. Enter the number of notes you want in the dialog that will open.
5. Press enter or click OK.

# Extra stuff

If anyone wants the original code but doesn't want to go to the comment section of the score to find the code, here it is:

`nfeditor.palette().currentPalette().applyTuplet=(e) => {if (e=="septuplet") {l=prompt("Enter number of notes in tuplet: ");nfeditor.documentController.controller.createTuplet(parseInt(l));} else {nfeditor.palette().currentPalette().applyAction("tuplet",{duplet:2,triplet:3,quadruplet:4,quintuplet:5,sextuplet:6}[e])}}`

But there's really no point in not going to the score because it's an amazing piece of music.

## Notes

In a later version, I might add an item to either the userscript context menu, the site context menu, or both, I'm not sure yet. I might also add a new button to the palette (obviously with [GM\_addElement](https://www.tampermonkey.net/documentation#api:GM_addElement)) for larger tuplets.
